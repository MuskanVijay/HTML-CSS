                <h2>The Founder Of Pakistan</h2> 
                <p>Quaid-e-Azam died on the 11th of September, 1948. He served his life for Pakistan.
                    He was a man of principles and always focused on the rights of his people. 
                    He emphasized education, stating that the future of our country depends 
                    upon the education we provide. He maintained equality and defined the roles 
                    of both men and women in the development of a prosperous state. 
                    He also emphasized industrial development as the main driver of the countryâ€™s
                    economic growth. Even in the hardest part of his health, he never stopped 
                    looking after his people. He strengthened them throughout his life, and a year
                    after the achievement of his dreamland, he passed away, instructing his people 
                    to follow a straight path and his directions.
